**Ansible** is an open-source platform by Red Hat that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, and application deployments.

Using Ansible, you can provision VMs, containers, and your entire cloud infrastructure.

Also, Ansible enables you to automate the deployment and configuration of resources in your environment such as:

-   Virtual networks.
-   Storage.
-   Subnets.
-   Resources groups.

Ansible is designed for multiple-tier deployments.

Unlike Puppet or Chef, Ansible is **agentless**, meaning you don't have to install software on the managed machines.

Ansible also models your IT infrastructure by describing how all your systems interrelate, rather than managing just one system at a time.
